## Continuous Integration (CI)

This project uses GitHub Actions to implement a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline that automates testing and release processes.

### Test Workflow

On every push to any branch, the test workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) is triggered. This workflow:

-   Checks out the source code.
-   Sets up the Java environment (JDK 17) using Temurin.
-   Retrieves the secret variable `GCP_API_KEY` and writes it to a `.env` file.
-   Runs the test suite using Maven (`mvn clean verify`).

### Release Workflow

The release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) is triggered manually or on every push to the `main` branch. This workflow:

-   Checks out the source code.
-   Sets up Docker Buildx for multi-architecture builds.
-   Logs in to DockerHub using a secret token.
-   Builds and pushes the Docker image for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms.
-   Uses GitHub Actions cache to optimize builds.

### Benefits

-   **Automation**: Tests are run automatically on every code change, ensuring quality and stability.
-   **Continuous delivery**: Docker images are automatically published to DockerHub on every release.
-   **Security**: Sensitive variables are managed through GitHub Secrets.
