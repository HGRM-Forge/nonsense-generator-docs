title: Nonsense Generator
---

Welcome to the Nonsense Generator! This application, developed by **HGRMForge** for the Software Engineering course (A.A. 2024-25) at the University of Padua, generates grammatically plausible but nonsensical sentences. It leverages the Google Cloud Natural Language API for sentence analysis and toxicity validation.

## Prerequisites

-   **Java**: JDK 17 or newer (for local execution).
-   **Docker**: Latest version (for Docker-based execution).
-   **GCP API Key**: A valid Google Cloud Platform API Key with the "Cloud Natural Language API" enabled.
-   For **Docker execution**, this key must be passed as an environment variable named `GCP_API_KEY` in your shell.
-   For **local execution (Spring Boot/IntelliJ)**, create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project with the following content (replace `YOUR_GCP_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual key). This file will be automatically picked up by the application:

```
GCP_API_KEY=YOUR_GCP_API_KEY_HERE
```

## Accessing the Web Application

Once the application is running, you can access the web interface at:
**http://localhost:8080**

## Getting Started

There are several ways to run the Nonsense Generator:

### 1. Using Docker Hub (Recommended for ease of use)

Ensure you have Docker installed and running.
The `-v "$(pwd)/buckets:/app/buckets"` command maps a directory named `buckets` in your current working directory to `/app/buckets` inside the container. This is useful when the application saves data.

```bash
# Pull and run the image from Docker Hub
docker run -v "$(pwd)/buckets:/app/buckets" -e GCP_API_KEY=YOUR_GCP_API_KEY_HERE -p 8080:8080 hgrm/nonsense-generator
```

### 2. Build Docker Image Locally

If you want to build the image from the source code:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/HGRM-Forge/nonsense-generator.git --recurse-submodules
cd nonsense-generator

# 2. Build the Docker image
docker build -t hgrm/nonsense-generator .

# 3. Run the container
docker run -v "$(pwd)/buckets:/app/buckets" -e GCP_API_KEY=YOUR_GCP_API_KEY_HERE -p 8080:8080 hgrm/nonsense-generator
```

### 3. With Spring Boot (Using Maven Wrapper)

This method runs the application directly using Spring Boot, ideal for development.
Ensure you have created the `.env` file in the project root as described in the "Prerequisites" section.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
git clone https://github.com/HGRM-Forge/nonsense-generator.git --recurse-submodules
cd nonsense-generator

# 2. Create .env file in the project root (if not already done) containing:
GCP_API_KEY=YOUR_GCP_API_KEY_HERE

# 3. Run the application using the Maven wrapper
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### 4. In IntelliJ IDEA (for Development)

1.  Clone the repository and open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (File -> Open -> select the `pom.xml` or root project folder).
2.  **Create `.env` file**: In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env` and add your API key:
    ```
    GCP_API_KEY=YOUR_GCP_API_KEY_HERE
    ```
    The Spring Boot application should pick this up when running locally.
3.  **Enable Annotation Processing**:
    -   Go to `File` > `Settings` (or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences` on macOS).
    -   Navigate to `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Compiler` > `Annotation Processors`.
    -   Check the box for "Enable annotation processing". Click `Apply` and `OK`.
4.  Run the main application class (named `NonsenseGeneratorApplication.java`).

## Running Tests

To execute the JUnit tests for the project, use the Maven wrapper. Ensure the `.env` file is present in the project root.

```bash
# From the project root directory
./mvnw test
```
